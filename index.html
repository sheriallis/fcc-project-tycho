        <h1>Tycho</h1>
        <p>
          Tycho (/ˈtaɪkoʊ/, like TIE-ko) is an American ambient music project led by Scott Hansen (born 1977) as primary composer, songwriter and producer. Hailing from San Francisco, California, he is known as ISO50 for his photographic and design works.
        </p>
        <p>
          His music is a combination of downtempo vintage-style synthesizers and ambient melodies.

        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p>
          Hansen's music project Tycho is influenced by and has been compared to artists such as DJ Shadow, Ulrich Schnauss and Boards of Canada. His music captures the sound of lo-fi analog media while remaining both progressive and futuristic in composition and style. Themes of nostalgia, longing, childhood and the natural world are interspersed throughout Tycho's work. Brief interludes or vignettes also feature in his earlier work. In Past Is Prologue, Hansen selected and included excerpts from broadcasts accompanied by atmospherics to capture a specific moment or mood. Overall, the mixture of electronic synths, live instrumentation, and old school sound clips creates a very relatable, organic sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until the release of the album Dive, Hansen worked as a solo artist and used the digital audio workstation, Cakewalk Sonar, to work with analog, virtual analog hardware, digital hardware and VSTI synthesizers as well as samples derived from live instrumentation, played by Hansen himself.
